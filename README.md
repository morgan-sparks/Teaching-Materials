# Teaching-Materials

This folder is filled with teaching materials I have made over the course of my PhD. It is meant to both be illustrative of how I prefer to design teaching materials around interactive coding work where students are provided code in advance and are able to participate with working code without having to keep up or remember the code moving forward. These also serve as a permanent resource where students can return and use over and over again.

### Basic R for undergraduates can be found [here](https://github.com/morgan-sparks/Teaching-Materials/blob/main/Basic-R-for-disease-lab.md)

### Basic ggplotting can be found [here](https://github.com/morgan-sparks/Teaching-Materials/blob/main/Intro-to-ggplot.md)


#### Files that end in `.md` will be rendered files and appear in a much more useable format
### Files that end in `.Rmd` are the raw Rmarkdown files that these were originally written in
